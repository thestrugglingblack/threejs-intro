        <h2>🐈‍⬛ About Loki 🐈‍⬛</h2>

        <p>
          Loki is the alpha cat. He is a Maine Coon mix. He was born on July 29, 2018 in Illinois. He was originally my little sister's cat. Then he became my little brother cat. Now he is my cat and I love him so much!  He loves to lounge on the cat ledge. He loves food....a little too much. His favorite meal is a can of tuna but he loves seafood flavored food. He has a black, gray and white coat. His belly is all white and his back has black stripes.

        <h2>🐈 Skarlet 🐈</h2>

        <p>
          Skarlet is a chill orange short hair tabby. She is a rare kind. The Ginger gene is normally dominated by male cats but she is my pretty ginger girl. She was born in June 8, 2020 and my cat. She  use to live with a house of other Ginger cats but she didnt get a long with them. She loves to bath out in the sun. She loves food too! She is very fast and agile and prefer to be left alone a lot. She loves to rub her scent on everything, including me! She has orange hair, white belly coat and a little birth mark on her lip.
